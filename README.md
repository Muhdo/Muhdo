- 👋 Hi, I’m Gabriel Valente.
- 👀 At the end of my academic carrer I developed an interest with web development, mostly back-end. Now I am working with Rails, and many can say its an annoying language, to work with but I like messing with it's weirdness.
- 🌱 I've worked with ReactJS, Node.js in personal projects and due to professional requirements, I started learning and working with Rails. I have a Bachelors degree in Computer Science, taken at Anglia Ruskin University.
- 💞️ Currently I am not (😞) looking for new opportunities, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't contact me 😉, here... I'll [help you](mailto:gabrielmcv1@gmail.com). 
- 📫 Anything just email me through `gabrielmcv1@gmail.com`.

As any developer my Github is a work in progress, however you have some of my finnished projects available to check, many others are just some stuff that I started but never finnished (Oopsi).
