- 👋 Hi, I’m Gabriel Valente.
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development (mostly backend), and Software Development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ReactJS, Node.js on my own and I am a Computer Scientist Student at Anglia Ruskin University.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some web projects, since I am enjoying to work both on the front as the backend.
- 📫 I'm available to respond to anything on my email, `gabrielmcv1@gmail.com`.

As any developer my Github is a work in progress, however you have many of my finnished projects available to check, many others are just some stuff that I started but never finnished.
