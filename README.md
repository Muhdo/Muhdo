- 👋 Hi, I’m Gabriel Valente.
- 👀 At the end of my academic career I developed an interest with web development, mostly back-end.
- 🌱 I've worked with ReactJS, Node.js in personal projects, now I am also learning Java and I can say that I am somewhat fluent in Java.
- 💼 Due to professional requirements, I have learned and I am working with Ruby on Rails. I have a Bachelors degree in Computer Science, from Anglia Ruskin University.
- 💞️ I am always looking for new opportunities and ways to be better in this field that I love, send me a mail if you want to... [here 😉](mailto:gabrielmcv1@gmail.com). 
- 📫 You can always email me through `gabrielmcv1@gmail.com`.

As any developer my Github is a work in progress, however you have some of my finnished projects available to check out, I have some others that are just... things that I have been trying out.
